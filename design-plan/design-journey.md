# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

My catalog website will be a wishlist for clothes shoppers who wish to have a place to store information about the article of clothing they wish to purchase, pertaining to the shops and retailers they may be able to purchase it from, the fit, material, origin, and miscellaneous information that is relevant to that piece of clothing.

### _Consumer_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _consumer_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)
>
My site’s consumer audience are online shoppers who need a catalog to store pictures, details, and links about the various clothes they want to buy.
This is a cohesive audience, because the user wants a website that they can interact with to add and remove new and old articles of clothing as they go about their fashion journey. Because clothing can be purchased in many places, the user wants a place to see what the piece of clothing looks like in a central location.


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1:  View pictures and details/descriptions of clothing

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - The design will have thumbnails and brief titles for each clothing, and the user will be able to click into the thumbnail and view a more detailed description of the clothing including where to buy it and other important details. They will also be able to store multiple photos of the clothing from sites, and to check the fits.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The user wants to know as much information about the piece of clothing in order to make a decision on when to buy it, where to buy it, and for comparison against other similar pieces of clothing.

Goal 2:Add/Remove entries in the catalog

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - The user will be able to use a form to submit new entries into the catalog, they’ll be able to upload multiple pictures at once.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - n order for the user to add new entries, a form is needed to allow the user to even consider this option.

Goal 3:Filter articles of clothing by tag

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - The user will be able to filter their wishlist by tags in order to see specific categories of clothing, I will use common design patterns to achieve this.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The user doesn't want to scroll through the wishlist to find a specific piece of clothing. Because we don't have a "search" feature like many other websites, its only reasonable to have a filtering option to let hte user "search" for stuff.


### _Consumer_ Audience Device (Milestone 1)
> How will your _consumer_ audience access this website? From a narrow (phone) or wide (laptop) device?
> Justify your decision. (1 sentence)

 The user will access the website from a laptop.
The PC/laptop option is justified because the user will be shopping from online through desktop websites.



### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _consumer_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

Kristin

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

The user wants to have a wishlist of clothing

**Goals:**

Kristin is a busy professional who values time and convenience
She is fashion-conscious and likes to keep up with the latest trends


**Obstacles:**

She wants to be able to easily access and manage her wishlist on-the-go

**Desires:**

She wants to be able to catalog her wishlist in a way that is intuitive and information rich.

### _Administrator_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _administrator_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

The administrator audience manages, moderates, adds, deletes data and details from the posts. If the pictures are marked for copyright or violate laws, the moderator has a role in removing said content.

This is a cohesive audience because the administrator needs to have super rights in order to view all data from all consumers.

### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _administrator_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Add/Remove/Moderate Content

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - The adminstrator will be able to view all of the user's wishlists and moderate the wishlists accordingly.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The adminstrator needs superrights to see everything, therefore having the ability to see, add, remove, and moderate content is essential to a functioning website.

Goal 2: Filter Content by Tags

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - The user will be able to filter their wishlist by tags in order to see specific categories of clothing, I will use common design patterns to achieve this.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The user doesn't want to scroll through the wishlist to find a specific piece of clothing. Because we don't have a "search" feature like many other websites, its only reasonable to have a filtering option to let hte user "search" for stuff.


### _Administrator_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _administrator_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

![Joe](/design-plan/joe.jpg)

Joe

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

Joe wants to moderate the catalog successfully with the proper features

**Goals:**

Joe wants to ensure there isn't inappropriate content on the wishlists

**Obstacles:**

Joe needs the ability to view all the content in order to moderate

**Desires:**

Joe desires to ensure the catalog is clean and legal.


### Catalog Data (Milestone 1)
> Using your personas, identify the data you need to include in the catalog for your site's audiences.
> Justify why this data aligns with your persona's goals. (1 sentence)
>
Brand data, size data, fit data, material data, picture data, various meta data, price data

This fits the personas goals because they need details to sort, moderate and add/remove content.



### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Design your catalog website to address the goals of your personas.
> Sketch your site's design:
>
> - These are **design** sketches, not _planning_ sketches.
> - Use text in the sketches to help us understand your design.
> - Where the content of the text is unimportant, you may use squiggly lines for text.
> - **Do not label HTML elements or annotate CSS classes.** This is not a planning sketch.
>
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch. (1 sentence)
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**

![Design-sketch](/design-plan/67CB6D49-5CB5-4874-B6B1-89956E58BC8B.jpg)

The sketch contains sketches of the home page, the form add page, and the view all page for the administrator.
These are the basic functions a user needs to use the website.


### Catalog Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Explain how you used design patterns in your site's design. (1-2 sentences)

I used familar patterns for the wishlist, opting for a gallery style wishlist with pictures and thumbnails. I went with a pretty standard form for the add form, and a view all table form for the adminstrator to view when moderating users and content.


## Implementation Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)
